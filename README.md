## 📜 About the project

This project was proposed by Rocketseat on Bootcamp GoStack. The goal is develop an app to explore Github repositóries, where you can add a repository and view its listed issues.

I've challenged myself and implemented some others features, beyond what was proposed on course, as toggle between dark and light theme, toggle between English and Portuguese language, remove repositories added, with double check, and deal with errors, for example, when to try to add an inexistent repository, API will return error, just clear the field and the error will dissapier, the same ocurr if to try to add and repository already included, to conclude, when to click on Search with empty field, will be returned error, just to click outside the field or press Esc to eliminate the error, the same ocurr if to click to remove a repository and give up.
